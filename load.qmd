## Loading of the raw data

To proceed with reading of raw data libraries needed for that are loaded

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
library("tidyverse")
library("here")
```

To read the file, name of it is needed.

```{r}
name_raw = "paad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_clinical_data.tsv"
```

With the name, the file is loaded.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
data_raw <- read_tsv(here("_raw",name_raw))
```

For further project work, file is saved. It ensures that work is never done on the raw data

```{r}
write_tsv(x = data_raw,file = here("data","data_load.tsv"))
```
