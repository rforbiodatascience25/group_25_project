## Loading of the raw data

To proceed with reading of raw data libraries needed for that are loaded

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("here")
```

To read the file, name of it is needed.

```{r}
name_raw = "paad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_clinical_data.tsv"
```

With the name, the main file can be loaded and then saved in proper place (data folder). It ensures that work is never done on the raw data.

```{r}
read_tsv(here("_raw",name_raw)) |>
  write_tsv(x = _,file = here("data","data_load.tsv"))
```
